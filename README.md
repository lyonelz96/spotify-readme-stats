# What the hell is this?

Server made in ExpressJS that serves svg 'widgets' that contain information
about your Spotify such as Top Artists, Recently Played and Top Artists. You
can use these to prettify your github profile!

## Examples
![Recently Played]()
![Top Tracks]()
![Top Artists]()

# Why?

I saw people have these fancy widgets on their github profile and I was curious
how they were getting that. Turns out they were just serving an svg through
some server and just displaying it using github markdown. Decided to give it a
go and here we are.
